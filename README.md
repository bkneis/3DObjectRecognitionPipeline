# Face Recognition Pipeline

The application's purpose is to benchmark the performance of several 3D face recognition 
algorithms. It is intended to easily create recognition pipelines consisting of different 
algorithms for experimental use.

### TODO

Extract logic from pipeline for checking the config values and building the void pointer 
parameters

Fix global descriptor graph

add FPDH descriptors

add form of classification

add sanity checks for config file reading
